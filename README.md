# k-means-vs.-NMTF
K-means++ and Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) with 2 and 3 components are compared in this research.
This work uses empirical analysis on a synthetic dataset of five 2D Gaussian distributions. The study examines clustering processes, evaluates starting options, and compares their performance using metrics like k-means functional Φ𝐾, silhouette scores, and NMTF reconstruction errors. Finally, the algorithms were applied to three datasets to complete this study.
